## Token Supply Analysis

### Current State (Mainnet)

| Metric | Value (e8s) | Value (PULSE) | Status |
|--------|-------------|---------------|--------|
| **Total Supply** | 135,150,100,099,700,000 | **1,351,501,000.997** | ‚ùå OVER CAP |
| **Maximum Cap** | 100,000,000,000,000,000 | **1,000,000,000** | Target |
| **Excess Supply** | 35,150,100,099,700,000 | **351,501,000.997** | ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS BURN |

### Decimal Breakdown
- **PULSE Decimals:** 8
- **1 PULSE** = 100,000,000 e8s (smallest units)
- **Transfer Fee:** 10,000 e8s = 0.0001 PULSE

## Token Distribution Analysis

### Account Balances

| Account | Type | Balance (e8s) | Balance (PULSE) | % of Supply |
|---------|------|---------------|-----------------|-------------|
| `amjys-ncnt7...7qe` | Minting Account | 100,000,000,100,000,000 | **1,000,000,001.00** | **73.99%** |
| `ej3ry-6qaa...lza-cai` | IDO Platform | 0 | **0** | **0%** |
| **Others** | Various | ~35,150,099,700,000 | ~**351,500,999.997** | **26.01%** |

## Key Findings

### üî¥ Finding #1: No Transfer to IDO Platform

**Expected:** 350,000,000 PULSE (35,000,000,000,000,000 e8s)
**Actual:** 0 PULSE
**Discrepancy:** 100%

The IDO platform canister `ej3ry-6qaaa-aaaai-atlza-cai` has **ZERO** PULSE tokens.

**Recommendation:**
- Verify if transfer was intended
- If yes, execute the transfer from minting account
- Update allocation tracking

---

### üî¥ Finding #2: Excess Supply Beyond Cap

**Problem:** Current supply is 1.351 billion PULSE, but the smart contract now enforces a 1 billion cap.

**How this happened:**
- Tokens were minted BEFORE the max supply cap was added to the contract
- The cap only prevents future minting, not retroactive enforcement

**Impact:**
- Violates investor expectations of fixed 1 billion supply
- Contradicts tokenomics documentation
- Reduces token scarcity value

**Required Action:** Burn 351,501,000.997 PULSE tokens

---

### üü° Finding #3: Token Concentration

**74%** of total supply is held by the minting account.

**Considerations:**
- High centralization risk
- Need clear distribution plan
- Consider multi-sig governance for minting account

---

## Recommended Actions

### Priority 1: Burn Excess Tokens

**Amount to Burn:** 351,501,000.997 PULSE (35,150,100,099,700,000 e8s)

**Steps:**
1. Transfer excess tokens to minting account (acts as burn)
2. Verify new total supply = 100,000,000,000,000,000 e8s
3. Update token stats page

**Command:**
```bash
dfx canister call tokenmania icrc1_transfer '(record {
  to = record {
    owner = principal "amjys-ncnt7-asur4-tubzo-hg6f4-5x5vi-udwtl-myst6-bphlp-tnmpu-7qe";
    subaccount = null;
  };
  amount = 35_150_100_099_700_000 : nat;
  fee = null;
  memo = null;
  from_subaccount = null;
  created_at_time = null;
})' --network ic
```

---

### Priority 2: Transfer to IDO Platform (If Intended)

**If 350M PULSE allocation to IDO is confirmed:**

**Amount:** 350,000,000 PULSE (35,000,000,000,000,000 e8s)

**Command:**
```bash
dfx canister call tokenmania icrc1_transfer '(record {
  to = record {
    owner = principal "ej3ry-6qaaa-aaaai-atlza-cai";
    subaccount = null;
  };
  amount = 35_000_000_000_000_000 : nat;
  fee = null;
  memo = null;
  from_subaccount = null;
  created_at_time = null;
})' --network ic
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è NOTE:** After burning excess, the total will be 1B. If you then transfer 350M to IDO:
- Minting account will have: ~650M PULSE
- IDO platform will have: 350M PULSE
- Total supply remains: 1B PULSE ‚úì

---

### Priority 3: Document Token Allocation

Create a transparent allocation table:

| Allocation | Amount (PULSE) | Percentage | Purpose |
|------------|----------------|------------|---------|
| IDO Platform | 350,000,000 | 35% | Public sale |
| Team/Treasury | 200,000,000 | 20% | Development |
| Airdrop/Rewards | 150,000,000 | 15% | User incentives |
| Liquidity Pool | 100,000,000 | 10% | DEX liquidity |
| Reserve | 200,000,000 | 20% | Future use |
| **Total** | **1,000,000,000** | **100%** | |

## Verification Checklist

After corrections, verify:

- [ ] Total supply = 100,000,000,000,000,000 e8s (1B PULSE)
- [ ] IDO platform has correct allocation (if applicable)
- [ ] Max supply cap is enforced in contract ‚úì (already done)
- [ ] Token stats page shows 100% minted correctly
- [ ] Allocation documented in README/tokenomics
- [ ] Investor communications updated

---

## Technical Notes

### ICRC-1 Token Standard Compliance

‚úÖ Implements: `icrc1_balance_of`, `icrc1_transfer`, `icrc1_total_supply`
‚úÖ Supports: ICRC-2 (approve/transferFrom)
‚úÖ Max supply enforcement: Added (needs burn to align)
‚úÖ Query functions exposed: `icrc1_max_supply()` available

### Smart Contract Location

**File:** `backend/tokenmania.mo`
**Max Supply Cap:** Line 20 (100,000,000,000,000,000 e8s)
**Enforcement:** Line 450-457 (classifyTransfer function)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate:** Decide on burn strategy (see Priority 1)
2. **Short-term:** Clarify IDO allocation (see Priority 2)
3. **Medium-term:** Document full token allocation plan
4. **Long-term:** Consider multi-sig for minting account

---

## Questions for Clarification

1. **Was 350M PULSE intended for IDO platform?**
   - If yes: Transfer needed after burn
   - If no: Update allocation plan

2. **Who currently holds the ~351M excess tokens?**
   - Are they distributed to users?
   - Or still in minting/team accounts?

3. **Token allocation plan finalized?**
   - What's the intended distribution?
   - Timeline for releases?
