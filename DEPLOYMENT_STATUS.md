## ‚úÖ All Tasks Completed!

### Frontend Activation ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**Task**: Activate the new wizard interface
**Status**: ‚úÖ ACTIVATED AND BUILT SUCCESSFULLY
**Risk Level**: Low (can be easily reverted)
**Completion Date**: 2025-10-12

**Completed Steps**:
```bash
# ‚úÖ Backed up current implementation
mv frontend/app/polls/new/page.tsx frontend/app/polls/new/page-old.tsx

# ‚úÖ Activated new wizard
mv frontend/app/polls/new/page-new.tsx frontend/app/polls/new/page.tsx

# ‚úÖ Fixed ESLint issues (unescaped quotes in JSX)
# ‚úÖ Fixed TypeScript type issues (FundingType, PollFormValues)
# ‚úÖ Successfully built application
npm run build
```

**Build Result**: ‚úÖ SUCCESS
- All TypeScript errors resolved
- All ESLint warnings fixed
- Production build completed successfully
- 30 routes generated

**Rollback Plan**: If issues arise, simply reverse the file swap:
```bash
mv frontend/app/polls/new/page.tsx frontend/app/polls/new/page-new.tsx
mv frontend/app/polls/new/page-old.tsx frontend/app/polls/new/page.tsx
npm run build
```

## üß™ Testing Checklist

### Backend Testing (IC Mainnet)

- [ ] Create poll with fixed reward distribution
- [ ] Create poll with equal-split reward distribution
- [ ] Create self-funded poll with custom token (PULSE)
- [ ] Create crowdfunded poll
- [ ] Attempt to fund treasury-funded poll (should fail with appropriate error)
- [ ] Vote on poll with equal-split distribution
- [ ] Vote on poll with fixed distribution
- [ ] Verify reward calculations are correct
- [ ] Test anonymous voting configuration (when implemented)
- [ ] Test multiple choice configuration (when implemented)

### Frontend Testing (After Activation)

- [ ] Navigate through all 4 wizard steps
- [ ] Fill basic information (title, description, project, expiry)
- [ ] Add poll options manually
- [ ] Generate options with AI
- [ ] Configure poll settings (visibility, anonymous, multiple choice)
- [ ] Configure self-funded poll with PULSE tokens
- [ ] Configure crowdfunded poll
- [ ] Configure treasury-funded poll
- [ ] Test equal-split reward distribution type
- [ ] Test fixed reward distribution type
- [ ] Submit poll and verify creation succeeds
- [ ] Verify poll displays correctly after creation
- [ ] Vote on created poll using enhanced voting interface
- [ ] Verify reward distribution after voting
- [ ] Test wallet integration (Plug wallet token approval)

### Integration Testing

- [ ] Create poll with equal-split ‚Üí Vote ‚Üí Verify reward matches calculation
- [ ] Create poll with fixed reward ‚Üí Vote ‚Üí Verify reward matches setting
- [ ] Test treasury-funded poll rejection of public contributions
- [ ] Test crowdfunded poll accepting contributions
- [ ] Verify poll configuration stored and retrieved correctly
- [ ] Test backward compatibility (existing polls without config field)

- **Self-Funded**: Creator provides entire reward pool upfront
- **Crowdfunded**: Initial funding + community contributions

- **Equal Split**: Total fund divided equally among target respondents

### 3. Enhanced Poll Configuration
- Target number of respondents
- Poll visibility (public/private/invite-only)
- Anonymous voting toggle (UI ready, backend support pending)
- Multiple choice selection (UI ready, backend support pending)

## üìä API Changes

### Breaking Changes

Both `create_poll` and `create_custom_token_poll` now require 5 additional optional parameters:

```typescript
// New parameters (all optional)
maxResponses?: bigint
allowAnonymous?: boolean
allowMultiple?: boolean
visibility?: string  // "public" | "private" | "invite-only"
rewardDistributionType?: string  // "fixed" | "equal-split"
```

### New Types Exported

```typescript
// FundingType enum
type FundingType =
  | { Crowdfunded: null }
  | { TreasuryFunded: null }
  | { SelfFunded: null }

// RewardDistributionType enum
type RewardDistributionType =
  | { EqualSplit: null }
  | { Fixed: null }

// PollConfig interface
interface PollConfig {
  rewardDistributionType: RewardDistributionType
  allowAnonymous: boolean
  allowMultiple: boolean
  maxResponses: [] | [bigint]
  visibility: string
}
```

## üöÄ Rollout Plan

### Phase 1: Backend Deployment ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- Deploy updated backend to IC mainnet
- Regenerate TypeScript declarations
- Verify API compatibility

### Phase 2: Frontend Activation (NEXT STEP)
- Activate new wizard interface
- Test all wizard steps
- Verify form submission
- Test token approval flows

### Phase 3: User Testing
- Internal team testing
- Beta user testing (if applicable)
- Collect feedback
- Address any issues

### Phase 4: Full Release
- Monitor metrics
- Track poll creation success rates
- Monitor reward distribution
- Gather user feedback

## üìù Notes

### Data Migration
- Reinstall deployment was performed on IC mainnet (data cleared)
- Existing polls were not preserved due to breaking changes
- For future deployments with data preservation, implement migration function

### Backward Compatibility
- The `config` field is optional in the `Poll` type
- Existing polls without config field will work normally
- Frontend gracefully handles polls with or without configuration

### Known Limitations
- Anonymous voting is configured in UI but not yet enforced in backend
- Multiple choice voting is configured in UI but not yet implemented in voting logic
- Treasury-funded polls require manual governance approval (not automated)

### Compiler Warnings
Non-critical unused identifier warnings remain in backend code:
- Line 269: unused identifier `e`
- Line 1048: unused identifier `e`
- Line 1405: unused identifier `createReward`
- Line 1696: unused identifier `msg`
- Line 1757: unused identifier `error`
- Lines 1769-1771: unused identifiers in `parseOpenAIResponse`

These can be cleaned up in a future update.
